# Lilly Technical Challenge Documentation Template

*This documentation template serves as a place for you to discuss how you approached this challenge, any issues you faced & how you overcame them, or any other points that you feel would be relevant for the interviewers to know.

## Approach
Repo initialization
*How did you approach this challenge? Did you work through the objectives in any particular order? If so, why? Did you utilize any external resources, such as tutorials, guides, or other materials?*


***My initial approach was to be the "user" and play around with the front-end, making tentative changes to the code to observe how things change; how things break. I used external resources like W3Schools to learn about the Python framework FastAPI, as well as how to use JSON to persist data. The objective I started with was the one to add medications; I felt like that was the perfect way to really get to learn about how the system works.***

## Problems Faced
*Use this space to document and discuss any issues you faced while undertaking this challenge and how you solved them. We recommend doing this proactively as you experience and resolve the issues - make sure you don't forget! (Screenshots are helpful, though not required)*.

***There was an initial struggle whereby the HTML form for the user to add a medication wasn't linking up with the FastAPI method; it was a good learning experience for the details of how the libraries in use actually work behind the scenes.***

## Evaluation
*How did you feel about the challenge overall? Did some parts go better than others? Did you run out of time? If you were to do this again, and were given more time, what would you do differently?*

***I really enjoyed the challenge, especially working with a front-to-back stack and seeing the entire journey of live data: from the front-end display and input to the persistence using a JSON file. Given more time I would improve the UX further and as well as add a 'delete' button for each medication.***
